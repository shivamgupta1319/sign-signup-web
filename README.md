# Django-Signin-signup
Creating a simple sign in and sign up view and then moving onto more advanced sign up view with profile model.

**I have also added a location field in custom profile model and stored all the basic information of  
 user using API, a little javascript and 
python without letting user know about it.

In this tutorial we will 

1. Create basic sign in view
2. Create sign up form with extra fields
3. Create profile model for users
4. create a login field

# Django Project Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. ```python manage.py migrate```
3. ```python manage.py createsuperuser```
